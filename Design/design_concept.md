Design Concept
For the most part, the design concept is that the information on the page is going through a mail delivery service.  The user will hover over transparent boxes on the side of the page to have information delivered on the conveyor belt.  I hope that the cartoonish style of the page will entertain users while demonstrating a basic concept of information being delivered to the user.
